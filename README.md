# Lyrics and Spotify Popularity

## Introduction
Song popularity can be influenced by many factors, but one factor has garnered less interest for consideration when predicting song popularity. This factor is the lyrical content of the song. This lack of interest could stem from the extra work required for processing text data and the fact that different genres can have differing vocabularies. Despite these difficulties, this project aimed to see if it was possible to predict a songâ€™s popularity solely using the lyrics alone. 

Limiting ourselves to only lyrics will make this objective harder to achieve, but being able to meet this objective would bring value to the songwriting industry. Specifically, our findings could enable individuals to write popular music more efficiently.
